# üåê Internet Standards Measurement Project ‚Äì DC-IS3C (Dynamic Coalition on Internet Standards, Security and Safety)

This repository is part of the **Dynamic Coalition on Internet Standards, Security and Safety (DC-IS3C)** within the **Internet Standards, Security and Safety Coalition (IS3C)** under the **Internet Governance Forum (IGF)**.  

It provides an **open-source, verifiable measurement platform** to evaluate the **adoption and deployment of Internet security, trust, and interoperability standards** globally, created by a group of experts in the technical community of **Latin America and Caribbean (LAC)** region.

The project includes:
- A **web interface** (`index.html`) that provides an interactive measurement dashboard.
- A **Node.js backend server** that performs technical checks on domains and returns structured JSON responses.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install and Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
By default, the server listens on port 4000.

Then, open index.html in your browser to use the measurement interface.

The web client consumes the backend endpoints below to run all tests dynamically.
